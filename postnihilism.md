# Postnihilism


## Introduction


In the vast expanse of human thought and philosophy, few concepts have been as simultaneously captivating and destructive as nihilism. This book embarks on a journey beyond the desolate landscapes of nihilistic thought, into the burgeoning realm of Postnihilism. It is an exploration driven by a core assertion: that nihilism, in its various forms and manifestations, has not only failed us but has actively contributed to a fragmentation and desolation of the human spirit, leaving us grappling with a crisis of meaning that permeates every facet of our lives.


The narrative of nihilism, with its roots deeply embedded in the soil of philosophical skepticism, posits that life is inherently devoid of meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. This perspective, while initially offering a form of liberation from the shackles of unfounded beliefs and societal constructs, has spiraled into a vortex of despair and disconnection. The so-called "optimistic nihilism" that emerged as a modern antidote to existential dread has, paradoxically, left us more isolated and adrift than ever before. The evidence of its failure is not merely anecdotal but is etched into the very fabric of our societies, manifesting in a multitude of crises that we can no longer afford to ignore.


At the heart of nihilism's destructive legacy is its insidious influence on a range of ideologies and systems, from neoliberalism to late-stage capitalism. These frameworks, underpinned by nihilistic assertions that nothing is sacred, have elevated money, corporations, and special interests to the status of deities in a secular pantheon. This commodification of life and disregard for intrinsic value have paved the way for some of the darkest chapters in human history, including genocides predicated on the chilling rationale that life, deemed meaningless, can be extinguished without moral consequence.


The repercussions of nihilistic thought extend far beyond the realm of economics and politics, giving rise to what can be termed the "Nihilistic Crisis." This crisis is characterized by the Four Abandonments: childhood, social, cosmic, and self. The phenomenon of latchkey kids and the normalization of isolation are symptomatic of a deeper malaise, where the abandonment experienced in childhood cascades into social abandonment, reflected in the disintegration of community bonds and the erosion of empathy in public policy and discourse. This social fragmentation is, in turn, rooted in cosmic abandonment—the spiritual void left by the retreat of transcendent narratives and the rise of secularism, leading to an existential bleakness that permeates our collective consciousness. The culmination of these abandonments is the self-abandonment, a surrender to despair that finds expression in the nihilistic resignation of being "black pilled."


The downstream impacts of nihilism are manifold, from the entrenchment of late-stage capitalism to the proliferation of social ills such as the meaning crisis and the loneliness epidemic. While it would be reductive to attribute these complex phenomena solely to nihilism, it is undeniable that nihilistic narratives have played a pivotal role in shaping the global landscape, riding on the coattails of neoliberalism, techno-optimism, and other prevailing ideologies.


In the face of this existential quagmire, this book proposes a radical departure from the nihilistic paradigm: the development of Postnihilism. Postnihilism is a philosophical stance that affirms the inherent value and meaning of life, grounded in the axiomatic assertion that "life is meaningful" or "life is good." This assertion is not a naive dismissal of the challenges and absurdities of existence but a foundational principle from which we can construct a more hopeful and cohesive understanding of our place in the universe.


From a scientific perspective, life is a phenomenon of unparalleled complexity and wonder, a dance of matter and energy that defies the entropy of the cosmos. Philosophically, life is the crucible in which meaning is forged; without the subjective experiences afforded by consciousness, the very concepts of reason, value, and purpose would be inconceivable. Postnihilism, therefore, posits that life, in its myriad forms and expressions, is the bedrock upon which meaning is built.


This book is an invitation to embark on a journey towards Postnihilism, to rekindle the flames of meaning in a world darkened by nihilistic despair. It is a call to arms for philosophers, scientists, artists, and individuals from all walks of life to engage in a collective endeavor to redefine our relationship with existence. Through the lens of Postnihilism, we can begin to heal the fractures wrought by nihilism, weaving a tapestry of meaning that celebrates the intrinsic value of life and the boundless potential of the human spirit.


As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, the transition from nihilism to Postnihilism offers a beacon of hope, a philosophical lifeline that can guide us towards a future where life is revered, meaning is cherished, and the human condition is elevated to new heights of understanding and compassion. The path ahead is fraught with challenges, but the promise of Postnihilism illuminates the way forward, beckoning us to embrace the profound beauty and significance of our shared existence.


# Rise of Nihilism


## The Printing Press


The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century stands as one of the pivotal moments in human history, a technological revolution that irrevocably altered the course of society, culture, and thought. This remarkable innovation democratized knowledge, breaking the stranglehold that the Church and the aristocracy had on information and learning. By making books—and thus, ideas—more accessible to a broader segment of the population, the printing press ignited a liberation of thought that would eventually challenge the very foundations of established power and belief systems.


The liberation of thought catalyzed by the printing press set the stage for the Reformation, a seismic shift in religious and political landscapes across Europe. Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses, perhaps the most famous document of the Reformation, was disseminated widely thanks to the printing press, allowing it to reach an audience far beyond what would have been possible in the pre-print era. This was a clear demonstration of how the spread of print could foment radical change, challenging the Church's monopoly on spiritual authority and paving the way for the rise of secularism.


The impact of the printing press extended far beyond the Reformation. The Enlightenment, a period characterized by an explosion of scientific inquiry, philosophical debate, and political revolution, was fueled by the widespread availability of printed material. Ideas could now be shared, critiqued, and built upon at an unprecedented pace, leading to rapid advancements in knowledge and a growing skepticism towards traditional sources of authority. The French Revolution, with its rallying cry for liberty, equality, and fraternity, was in many ways a product of this new, print-enabled intellectual climate, as revolutionary ideas circulated through pamphlets, newspapers, and books.


It was against this backdrop of burgeoning secularism and the questioning of traditional values that Friedrich Nietzsche declared, "God is dead, we have killed him." This provocative statement, emblematic of the existential and nihilistic currents that would come to define much of modern philosophy, was a direct consequence of the cultural and intellectual shifts set in motion by the printing press. Nietzsche's declaration was not merely an observation about the decline of religious belief but a profound commentary on the vacuum of meaning and purpose left in the wake of this decline. The death of God symbolized the dissolution of a unifying narrative that had provided structure and meaning to human existence for centuries.


The rise of nihilism, then, can be traced directly back to the printing press and the liberation of thought it engendered. The freedom of information that the printing press facilitated indeed had a way of shaking things up, challenging established dogmas and empowering individuals to question, reason, and seek truth on their own terms. However, this liberation also led to a fragmentation of belief systems and a crisis of meaning, as traditional sources of authority and value were eroded.


Nietzsche's insight into the consequences of the death of God foreshadowed the existential and nihilistic dilemmas that would come to dominate much of the 20th and 21st centuries. The vacuum left by the decline of religious belief and the disintegration of cohesive narratives about the world and our place in it has led to a widespread search for meaning in an increasingly secular, fragmented, and uncertain world.


## Modernism to Postmodernism


The intellectual and cultural trajectory from Modernism to Postmodernism represents a profound shift in the Western conception of truth, meaning, and authority. This transition, deeply intertwined with the broader narrative of secularization and the questioning of traditional sources of authority, reflects a fundamental reevaluation of the foundations upon which Western thought had been built for centuries.


Modernism, emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was characterized by a steadfast belief in progress, rationality, and the existence of absolute truths and universal principles. Rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, Modernism inherited a worldview that saw truth and meaning as divine absolutes, bestowed from on high and waiting to be discovered by humanity. This perspective was not merely a continuation of religious thought but a rational approximation of the notion "as God wills it," adapted to an age increasingly defined by scientific discovery and enlightenment ideals. Modernists believed that through the application of reason and the scientific method, humanity could uncover the underlying truths of the universe, leading to a better, more enlightened world.


However, the Modernist project began to show cracks as it came into contact with the broader global community. The Western intellectual tradition, with its Judeo-Christian underpinnings and belief in absolute truths, struggled to reconcile its worldview with the diverse array of perspectives and belief systems encountered in an increasingly interconnected world. This tension was exacerbated by the atrocities of the World Wars, which called into question the Modernist faith in progress and rationality. The disillusionment with Modernism's promises led to a profound reevaluation of its foundational assumptions.


Postmodernism emerged as a response to the perceived failures of Modernism, challenging the very notion of universal truths and objective reality. Postmodern thinkers argued that truth and meaning are not absolute and waiting to be discovered but are instead constructed by societies and individuals, shaped by cultural, historical, and linguistic contexts. This radical relativism upended the Modernist belief in the authority of reason and science, declaring that there are no ultimate gatekeepers of truth. The assertion that "all truth is relative" and the rejection of grand narratives and universal principles marked a significant departure from the Modernist worldview.


While the rise of Postmodernism had several beneficial effects on society, such as promoting a more meritocratic and participatory economy and reinforcing the principle of "equality before the law," it also contributed to a spiritual and existential void. The rejection of absolute truths and the questioning of intellectual authority left many grappling with a sense of uncertainty and meaninglessness. This spiritual bleakness, which began to take shape in the 1930s, reached a critical point in the 1980s with the global ascendance of neoliberalism—a socio-economic paradigm that further entrenched the relativistic and individualistic ethos of Postmodernism.


Neoliberalism, with its emphasis on market deregulation, privatization, and the primacy of individual choice, can be seen as both a product and a catalyst of the Postmodern condition. The neoliberal project, by championing the free market as the ultimate arbiter of value and dismissing the idea of collective goods and shared values, exacerbated the existential and moral vacuum left by the retreat of Modernist certainties. The combination of Postmodernism's relativism and nihilism with neoliberalism's economic doctrines created a potent mix that has profoundly shaped the contemporary world, leaving us to grapple with the consequences of a society unmoored from shared meanings and collective purposes.


As we delve deeper into the implications of this intellectual and cultural shift, it becomes clear that the journey from Modernism to Postmodernism, and the subsequent rise of neoliberalism, represents a critical juncture in the Western narrative. This transition has not only reshaped our understanding of truth, authority, and meaning but has also set the stage for the existential challenges and opportunities that define our current era.


## Nothing is Sacred


The sweeping tide of secularism, coupled with the ascendancy of postmodern thought, has indeed ushered in an era marked by a profound skepticism towards ancient wisdom and traditional knowledge. This skepticism, while rooted in the laudable scientific pursuit of questioning and evidence-based understanding, has often veered into a categorical rejection of anything perceived as old or antiquated. The mantra of the age seems to be that in the quest for progress and enlightenment, all that is old must be scrutinized, and often, discarded. This approach, though it has yielded undeniable benefits in terms of technological and scientific advancements, has also led to a significant cultural and spiritual void, encapsulated in the axiom "Nothing is sacred."


The relentless drive to question and overturn long-held assumptions is a hallmark of the scientific method and a key engine of progress. However, the application of this drive in a cultural and philosophical context has sometimes led to an overzealous dismissal of traditional wisdom. The modern world, with its emphasis on novelty, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of progress, often views ancient wisdom through a lens of skepticism, if not outright disdain. This perspective, while it has helped to dismantle harmful superstitions and outdated practices, has also led to a devaluation of the profound insights and enduring truths that have been passed down through generations.


The rise of secularism and postmodernism has further exacerbated this trend. As the world became more secular, the spiritual and moral frameworks that had underpinned societies for millennia were increasingly viewed as relics of a bygone era, incompatible with a modern, rational worldview. Postmodernism, with its emphasis on relativism and the rejection of grand narratives, has contributed to a cultural milieu in which the very idea of universal truths or sacred values is met with skepticism. The result is an intellectual, philosophical, and cultural environment in which the notion of the sacred has been eroded, leaving a vacuum where once there were shared meanings and collective purposes.


This environment has had tangible effects on the way knowledge is pursued and valued. The scientific community, in its quest to rigorously understand the world, often finds itself "rediscovering" truths that were once common knowledge, encapsulated in ancient wisdom and traditional practices. The publication of scientific studies validating phenomena that have long been recognized by non-scientific means—such as the importance of love and physical affection in child development—highlights the extent to which the modern ethos of "nothing is sacred" has led to a disconnect from the wisdom of the past.


While the scientific validation of these truths is undoubtedly valuable, it also raises questions about the wisdom of completely discarding traditional knowledge in favor of a purely empirical approach. The categorical rejection of ancient wisdom not only impoverishes our cultural and spiritual lives but also risks overlooking valuable insights that could inform and enrich our understanding of the world.


In this context, the challenge for contemporary society is to find a balance between the critical scrutiny that is the hallmark of scientific inquiry and a respectful engagement with the wisdom of the past. Recognizing that not all that is old is outdated, and not all that is new is necessarily an improvement, is a crucial step towards creating a more holistic and integrated approach to knowledge. By acknowledging that something can be sacred, even in a secular age, we open ourselves to a richer, more nuanced understanding of the human experience, one that bridges the gap between ancient wisdom and modern insights.


# Nihilistic Crisis


## The Four Abandonments


The Nihilistic Crisis, a pervasive and insidious pattern that has woven itself into the fabric of contemporary society, is a phenomenon that defies a clear beginning or end. Instead, it is a cyclical mélange that perpetuates itself through the interplay of the Four Abandonments, each feeding into and exacerbating the others in a relentless spiral. This crisis, though it manifests in myriad ways across different contexts, follows a trajectory that can be traced through the stages of life, from childhood to adulthood, painting a portrait of a society grappling with profound disconnection and existential despair.


The first of these abandonments, childhood abandonment, sets the stage for the unfolding crisis. The phenomenon of "latchkey kids," prevalent from the 1970s through the 1990s, and the contemporary equivalent of children raised by screens, epitomize this initial stage of abandonment. In both instances, children grow up in environments where emotional connection and familial bonds are secondary to the demands of work and the pursuit of individual fulfillment. The rise of dual-income nuclear families, often isolated from the broader support networks of extended family and community, creates a breeding ground for emotional deprivation. This upbringing, marked by a lack of close, nurturing relationships, primes individuals for a life characterized by anxiety, boredom, depression, and isolation. The seeds of the Nihilistic Crisis are sown in these formative years, as children learn to navigate a world in which emotional connection and communal bonds are undervalued.


The second abandonment, a continuation and reenactment of the first, manifests in the realm of social and political life. The emotional deprivation experienced in childhood finds its reflection in the actions of cynical politicians, the dismantling of social safety nets, and a culture of hostility, suspicion, and isolation. The prepper phenomenon, characterized by individuals preparing for societal collapse in isolation rather than imagining collective survival, is a stark illustration of this abandonment. Similarly, the "forever alone" memes and movements like MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) underscore a pervasive sense of disconnection and disillusionment with the possibility of meaningful relationships. This social abandonment reinforces and is reinforced by the initial childhood abandonment, creating a feedback loop of isolation and cynicism.


The third abandonment, cosmic abandonment, confronts individuals with the existential terror of an apparently cold, careless, and empty universe. This stage of abandonment grapples with the profound existential questions that arise when traditional narratives of meaning and purpose are stripped away, leaving a void that is both terrifying and maddening. The realization that the universe may not offer inherent meaning or solace exacerbates the sense of disconnection and purposelessness, deepening the nihilistic crisis.


Finally, the crisis culminates in self-abandonment, a stage marked by a complete surrender to despair. Individuals who reach this point, often described as "black pilled," succumb to a worldview devoid of hope or meaning. This abandonment manifests in extreme forms, such as school shootings and deaths from despair, representing a total breakdown of the individual's capacity to find meaning or connection in the world.


The Nihilistic Crisis, powered by the Four Abandonments, is not merely a collection of social trends or individual pathologies but a reflection of a deeper malaise that permeates contemporary society. This crisis challenges us to confront the profound implications of a world in which traditional sources of meaning and connection have been eroded. As we navigate this landscape, the task before us is not only to understand the dynamics of the Nihilistic Crisis but to seek pathways out of the abyss, forging new narratives of meaning and community in the face of existential despair.


## Learned Helplessness


From the depths of the Nihilistic Crisis, a peculiar phenomenon has emerged, one that attempts to reframe the bleak landscape of nihilism into something more palatable, more bearable. This phenomenon, known as Optimistic Nihilism, purports to offer a silver lining to the existential void, suggesting that the absence of inherent meaning in the universe frees us to create our own purpose and revel in the sheer randomness of existence. However, when viewed through the lens of the Nihilistic Crisis and the Four Abandonments, Optimistic Nihilism appears less like a genuine solution and more like a coping mechanism, a psychological salve for the deep wounds inflicted by a lifetime of abandonment, loneliness, and isolation.


Optimistic Nihilism, in this light, can be likened to a form of Stockholm Syndrome or learned helplessness, where individuals, battered by the relentless forces of nihilistic despair, come to embrace their captor. It is a survival strategy, born out of necessity, that allows individuals to find some semblance of peace in a world that seems devoid of meaning and connection. This perspective invites a more empathetic view of those who have "drank the kool-aid" of nihilism, recognizing the profound pain and disconnection that drives them towards such a philosophy. Like zoo animals confined to tiny cages for their entire lives, who lose the ability to thrive in freedom once it is offered, individuals steeped in nihilism may find themselves unable to embrace a more hopeful or meaningful worldview, even when the possibility presents itself.


Yet, while empathy for the plight of those caught in the grip of nihilism is essential, it is equally crucial to recognize the limitations and dangers of Optimistic Nihilism as a response to the Nihilistic Crisis. By framing nihilism in optimistic terms, there is a risk of normalizing the crisis, of making peace with a state of affairs that should instead be challenged and transcended. Optimistic Nihilism, for all its attempts to inject a dose of positivity into the nihilistic worldview, ultimately falls short of addressing the root causes of the crisis—the profound sense of abandonment, disconnection, and existential despair that plagues contemporary society.


It is time to draw a line in the sand, to say "enough" to the coping mechanisms, the learned helplessness, and the Stockholm Syndrome that have characterized our collective response to nihilism. Nihilism, whether dressed in the guise of optimism or not, has failed us. It has led us into a spiritual and existential quagmire, from which we must now find a way out. The task before us is not to make peace with the void but to seek out new narratives, new philosophies, and new ways of being that affirm the value of life, the importance of connection, and the possibility of meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe.


The journey beyond nihilism, towards a worldview that embraces life in all its complexity and mystery, will not be easy. It requires courage, imagination, and a willingness to confront the pain and disconnection that have driven us into the arms of nihilism. But it is a journey worth undertaking, for it holds the promise of a more connected, meaningful, and vibrant existence. As we embark on this path, let us carry with us a sense of empathy for those still trapped in the nihilistic mindset, while steadfastly seeking a future that moves beyond the limitations of nihilism, optimistic or otherwise.


## Childhood Abandonment


The First Abandonment, Childhood Abandonment, represents a foundational rupture in the fabric of human connection and emotional development, setting the stage for the myriad crises that define the contemporary age. At the heart of this abandonment lies childhood emotional neglect, a pervasive epidemic that begins in the earliest stages of life and casts a long shadow over the emotional landscape of successive generations. This neglect is not merely a byproduct of individual parental failings but is deeply embedded in cultural practices, societal norms, and historical traumas that have shaped the way we understand and engage with emotional well-being.


The "cry it out" philosophy, a contentious approach to infant sleep training, serves as a poignant symbol of this broader trend of emotional neglect. Advocates of this method argue that it teaches self-soothing and independence, yet critics highlight the profound psychological cost: training children's nervous systems from shortly after birth to accept that their cries for comfort and connection will go unanswered. This early lesson in abandonment does not end in infancy but reverberates throughout life, keeping individuals' amygdalae—the part of the brain responsible for processing emotions, especially fear and threat—on high alert, fostering a state of perpetual emotional vigilance.


The roots of Childhood Abandonment extend beyond parenting philosophies to encompass broader societal and historical factors. The collective trauma of multiple World Wars in the 20th century, for example, has left deep psychological scars on entire populations, scars that have been passed down through generations in the form of emotional unavailability and incompetence. Parents, grappling with the unprocessed trauma of global conflict, have often found themselves ill-equipped to provide the emotional nurturing and support their children need, perpetuating a cycle of emotional neglect.


Compounding this intergenerational trauma is a cultural infatuation with Stoicism, a philosophy that, while offering valuable insights into resilience and personal responsibility, has been interpreted by some as advocating for emotional suppression. This misinterpretation has contributed to a climate in which emotions are viewed with hostility and skepticism, further entrenching the patterns of emotional deprivation that characterize Childhood Abandonment.


The consequences of this abandonment are starkly evident across generational lines. Generation X, raised in the shadow of the Cold War and the economic upheavals of the late 20th century, was the first to feel the full brunt of these shifting emotional landscapes. Millennials, coming of age in a world defined by rapid technological change and increasing global instability, have fared even worse, grappling with heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and existential uncertainty. Gen Z, however, faces the most daunting emotional landscape of all, born into a world where screens mediate human interaction, and the ethos of emotional neglect is deeply entrenched in the fabric of daily life.


This trajectory of deepening emotional crisis is not merely a series of isolated incidents but a symptom of a much larger problem: the worship of the economy above all else. The prioritization of economic growth and productivity over human connection and emotional well-being has led to a society where dual-income households are the norm, not out of a desire for material excess, but out of economic necessity. In this environment, screens become surrogates for human interaction, and "cry it out" mantras are rationalized as necessary sacrifices on the altar of economic efficiency.


The First Abandonment, then, is not just about the failure of individual parents or the adoption of controversial child-rearing philosophies. It is about a societal failure to prioritize emotional well-being, a failure that has its roots in the broader cultural, historical, and economic forces that shape our lives. As we confront the legacy of Childhood Abandonment, it becomes clear that nihilism, with its rejection of inherent meaning and value, offers no solace or solution to this crisis. Instead, we must seek new paradigms that affirm the importance of emotional connection, intergenerational healing, and the intrinsic value of human life, beyond the dictates of the economy.


## Social Abandonment


The Second Abandonment, Social Abandonment, unfolds as a natural progression from the emotional desolation sown in the early stages of life, magnifying the impact of the Nihilistic Crisis on a societal scale. As generations raised in the shadow of emotional neglect ascend to adulthood, the patterns of disconnection and scarcity of empathy that characterized their upbringing are inadvertently perpetuated, creating a cycle of emotional abandonment that extends far beyond the confines of the family unit. This cycle, driven by a lack of emotional literacy and a deep-seated fear of vulnerability, manifests in a society where touch and emotional starvation become the norm, rather than the exception.


Parents, themselves the products of emotionally impoverished environments, often find themselves ill-equipped to navigate the emotional landscapes of their children. Confronted with expressions of fear, sadness, or anger, they react in the only ways they know how—through suspicion, hostility, or outright dismissal. This reaction, a mirror of the responses they received from their own parents, represents a form of intergenerational reenactment, a perpetuation of the cycle of emotional abandonment that has become a defining feature of contemporary society.


The ramifications of this cycle extend far beyond the family, shaping the very fabric of social and political life. Emotionally abandoned children, having grown up in an environment where their most basic emotional needs were unmet, mature into adults who carry these unhealed wounds into the public sphere. As voters, they are drawn to politicians who reflect their own trauma, often favoring leaders who espouse toughness, stoicism, and a disdain for vulnerability. As employers, they replicate the emotionally sterile environments of their upbringing, prioritizing productivity and efficiency over the emotional well-being of their employees. The result is a pervasive miasma of emotional neglect that suffuses every level of society, reinforcing the belief that the solution to our collective malaise lies in more stoicism, more toughness, and a return to traditional values of emotional suppression.


This belief is encapsulated in the criticism of those deemed "too sensitive" or dismissed as "snowflakes," a rhetoric that valorizes emotional detachment and denigrates empathy and sensitivity as signs of weakness. The irony, of course, is that this call for more stoicism and a return to patriarchal norms is itself a symptom of the very fragility it seeks to condemn—a fragility born of unacknowledged pain and unhealed trauma.


The notion that society's ills could be remedied by more warmth, more empathy, and a greater emphasis on emotional literacy from childhood onwards is a perspective that has been conspicuously absent from public discourse. Instead, we find ourselves trapped in a cycle of "trauma politics," where traumatized voters elect traumatized politicians, perpetuating a system that is fundamentally incapable of addressing the root causes of our collective disconnection.


Breaking this cycle requires a radical reevaluation of our values and priorities, both as individuals and as a society. It demands that we recognize the profound impact of emotional abandonment on our collective psyche and begin the difficult work of healing the wounds that have been passed down through generations. Only by confronting the legacy of the Second Abandonment and embracing a new paradigm of emotional engagement and vulnerability can we hope to forge a society that is truly resilient, compassionate, and connected.


## Cosmic Abandonment


The Third Abandonment, Cosmic Abandonment, represents perhaps the most profound and existential dimension of the Nihilistic Crisis. It is a crisis not just of faith or philosophy, but of our very place in the cosmos. As humanity has advanced in its understanding of the universe, the comforting narratives that once placed us at the center of a meaningful, divinely orchestrated cosmos have been systematically dismantled. The Enlightenment and the rise of Modernism may have set the stage for this cosmic reevaluation, but it is in the contemporary era that the full weight of our cosmic insignificance has truly been felt.


Today, when we gaze into the heavens, we are confronted not with the reassuring presence of a fatherly deity, but with the vast, indifferent expanse of the universe. The more we learn about the cosmos, the more it appears to be a place that is not only devoid of life but fundamentally hostile to our existence. The realization that we might be nothing more than a cosmic accident, a brief spark of consciousness in an otherwise lifeless void, has profound implications for our understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.


This cosmic perspective, which sees humanity as an insignificant blip in the grand scheme of things, has fueled a deep sense of disillusionment and self-loathing. The narrative that once told us we were special, created in the image of a supreme being and placed at the center of the universe, has been replaced by a narrative of insignificance. We are, in this view, little more than a cancerous species, polluting our tiny island of safety in an otherwise inhospitable universe. This realization breeds a profound hatred and loathing, not just for ourselves, but for the universe that spawned us.


The irony of this cosmic abandonment is not lost on the nihilists, who seize upon it as evidence of their worldview. They point to the apparent meaninglessness of our existence in an indifferent universe and declare, "See! We are right, there is no meaning!" For some, this realization evokes not just despair but rage against a deity that, if it exists at all, must be sadistic to have created such a cruel joke. Rather than grappling with the despair and seeking a path through it, nihilists accept this view of cosmic abandonment as axiomatic, a foundational truth upon which their philosophy is built.


Yet, this acceptance of cosmic abandonment as the final word on the human condition represents a failure of imagination and a surrender to despair. It overlooks the possibility that meaning and purpose might not be things that are given to us from on high but are instead things that we create for ourselves. In the face of cosmic indifference, the challenge is not to succumb to nihilism but to assert our own significance, to find meaning in the connections we forge with each other and the world around us.


The Third Abandonment challenges us to confront the deepest questions of existence: Who are we in the vastness of the cosmos? What does it mean to live a meaningful life in a universe that does not care? These are not easy questions, and they do not admit of simple answers. But in wrestling with them, we open ourselves to the possibility of forging a new understanding of our place in the universe, one that acknowledges our cosmic insignificance while affirming the profound significance of our existence to each other. It is in this struggle, this refusal to accept cosmic abandonment as the final word, that we might find a path through the nihilistic despair that has gripped our age.


## Self Abandonment


The Fourth Abandonment, Self Abandonment, represents the culmination of the Nihilistic Crisis, the point at which the accumulated weight of emotional neglect, societal disconnection, and cosmic disillusionment becomes too much to bear. It is the stage at which individuals, confronted with a lifetime of touch starvation, emotionally incompetent families, and a society that seems fundamentally broken, make the decision—consciously or unconsciously—to give up. This abandonment is not merely a withdrawal from society but a profound disengagement from life itself, a surrender to the despair that has shadowed them since childhood.


The manifestations of Self Abandonment are as varied as they are tragic. We see it in the unwashed, lonely men who retreat into the echo chambers of the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) movement, in the "black pilled" teens who view the world through a lens of unrelenting pessimism, and in the perpetrators of mass and school shootings, who externalize their despair in acts of violence. Deaths from despair—suicides, overdoses, and the slow self-destruction of chronic substance abuse—are on the rise, painting a grim picture of a generation that is checking out before their lives have truly begun.


This epidemic of Self Abandonment unfolds in a world overflowing with entertainments and distractions, a world that promises endless avenues for escape but offers little in the way of genuine connection or meaning. The hopelessness and despair that drive individuals to self-abandonment are, in this context, not only understandable but almost inevitable. The seeds of this despair are sown in early childhood, in the moments when a sad toddler reaches out for comfort and finds none, learning the harsh lesson that their emotional needs will go unmet.


The cycle of abandonment and neglect finds expression in a myriad of ways, some more subtle than others. The phenomenon of "fatfluencers" and "feedies," who valorize excessive weight gain as a form of rebellion or self-expression, can be seen as a form of Self Abandonment. For many, the relationship with food is complicated by early experiences of emotional neglect, where feeding was used as a substitute for genuine emotional engagement. This pattern of using food as a means of self-soothing becomes a form of self-abandonment, a slow suicide that mirrors the emotional dynamics of their upbringing.


It is important to emphasize that the aim here is not to criticize individuals who find themselves trapped in these patterns of Self Abandonment. Rather, it is to critique the societal structures and familial dynamics that have created the conditions for such despair to flourish. The cycle of emotional incompetence, societal disconnection, and cosmic disillusionment that leads to Self Abandonment is not the fault of any one individual but is a systemic issue that requires a systemic response.


Once we begin to recognize the signs of this nihilistic Self Abandonment, we see it everywhere, in the quiet desperation of lives lived in the shadow of unmet needs and unhealed wounds. The challenge, then, is to confront this crisis not with judgment or condemnation but with empathy and a commitment to change. By addressing the root causes of emotional neglect, societal disconnection, and cosmic disillusionment, we can begin to forge a society that offers not just distractions and entertainments but genuine connection, meaning, and hope. It is only through such a collective effort that we can hope to stem the tide of Self Abandonment and create a world where despair is met with compassion, and abandonment is replaced with belonging.


# Unintended Consequences


## The Good Old Days


In the grand tapestry of human history, the Enlightenment, Modernism, and Postmodernism represent pivotal moments of intellectual, cultural, and societal evolution. Each of these movements, with their emphasis on scientific inquiry, rational skepticism, and the questioning of traditional narratives, has contributed profoundly to the shape of the modern world. The Enlightenment's valorization of reason and empirical evidence laid the groundwork for the scientific and technological advancements that have defined the modern era. Modernism, with its belief in progress and the power of human creativity, pushed the boundaries of art, literature, and thought. Postmodernism, meanwhile, challenged us to question the grand narratives and intellectual gatekeepers that had previously gone unchallenged, opening our eyes to a multitude of worldviews and perspectives.


The notion of equality before the law, a principle that has its roots in these intellectual movements, has likewise had a transformative impact on society. It has empowered women to engage as equals to men, facilitated the rise of dual-income homes, and contributed to unprecedented levels of social mobility. These changes, while undeniably positive in many respects, have also brought with them a set of unintended consequences that have contributed to the Nihilistic Crisis we face today.


Postmodernism's skepticism of narratives and intellectual authority, for example, has indeed broadened our horizons, allowing for a more inclusive and pluralistic understanding of the world. However, it has also plunged us into an intellectually confused space where the distinction between informed expertise and uninformed opinion has been blurred, leading to a cultural landscape where "truth" is often seen as subjective and all perspectives are considered equally valid, regardless of their basis in fact or logic.


Similarly, the empowerment of women and the rise of dual-income households have had profound economic and social benefits, but they have also contributed to the challenges of work-life balance, emotional neglect, and the erosion of traditional support networks. These developments, while advancing the cause of equality and individual freedom, have inadvertently played a role in the emotional and societal disconnections that underpin the Nihilistic Crisis.


In facing these challenges, it is tempting to look back with nostalgia to a perceived "simpler time" when traditional values and social structures provided a clear framework for life. However, such a retreat into the past is neither desirable nor possible. The advances in equality, scientific understanding, and cultural inclusivity that we have achieved are invaluable and must not be sacrificed in the quest to address the unintended consequences of progress.


Instead, we must forge a path forward that acknowledges the complexities and contradictions of the modern world. This requires a nuanced understanding of the merits and limitations of the intellectual movements that have shaped our society. It requires a commitment to preserving the gains we have made in terms of equality, scientific inquiry, and cultural pluralism, while also addressing the emotional, societal, and existential challenges that these gains have brought with them.


Moving forward, we must seek solutions that do not simply revert to the past but build upon the foundations of the Enlightenment, Modernism, and Postmodernism in new and innovative ways. This may involve reimagining our social structures, developing new models of community and support, and finding ways to integrate scientific and technological advancements with a renewed emphasis on emotional well-being and human connection.


The task before us is daunting, but it is also an opportunity—an opportunity to create a society that retains the best of what we have learned from the past while addressing the challenges of the present and future. By embracing complexity, fostering dialogue, and prioritizing empathy and connection, we can move beyond the Nihilistic Crisis and towards a future that is both intellectually vibrant and emotionally fulfilling.


## No One’s Fault


The quest to understand the roots of the Nihilistic Crisis and the pervasive sense of disconnection and despair that characterizes the modern world is a complex and multifaceted endeavor. It is tempting, in the face of such widespread malaise, to seek a singular culprit, a definitive cause that can be blamed for the myriad issues we face. However, the reality is far more intricate and cannot be distilled to the actions or philosophies of any one individual, no matter how influential they may have been.


Friedrich Nietzsche, the enigmatic philosopher who famously declared "God is dead," is often associated with the genesis of nihilistic thought. Yet, to view Nietzsche solely as a harbinger of despair is to overlook the nuance and depth of his work. Nietzsche grappled with the implications of a world devoid of inherent meaning, and in doing so, he sought to chart a path through the nihilism he foresaw. His philosophy, with its emphasis on the will to power, the eternal recurrence, and the creation of one's own values, can be seen as an early, albeit incomplete, attempt at Postnihilism. Nietzsche envisioned a world in which individuals, freed from the shackles of traditional morality and metaphysics, could forge their own destinies and find beauty and awe in the struggle of existence.


However, Nietzsche's philosophy, complex and often opaque, was not a panacea for the existential challenges of the modern world. Moreover, his personal struggles and the subsequent co-opting of his work by various ideologies have complicated his legacy. Nietzsche, for all his brilliance, was but one voice in a chorus of thinkers, artists, and visionaries who have wrestled with the meaning of life in an increasingly secular and disenchanted world.


The forces that have shaped the Nihilistic Crisis are myriad and have been in motion for centuries. The rise of scientific inquiry, the gradual evolution of social, political, and spiritual values, the seismic shifts brought about by technological advancements, globalization, and the advent of the internet—all of these factors have played a role in shaping the contemporary landscape. These trends are not the result of any single individual's actions but are the culmination of countless decisions, discoveries, and developments that have unfolded over time.


The process of uncovering these trends and understanding their impact on our collective psyche has been a Herculean task, requiring hundreds of hours of research, years of drafting and revising, and countless conversations and debates. The problem, like the solution, is nebulous, a tangled web of historical, cultural, and existential threads that defy easy explanation or resolution.


In facing this challenge, it is crucial to resist the temptation to assign blame or seek simple answers. The Nihilistic Crisis, with its deep roots in the history of human thought and culture, cannot be attributed to any one person or philosophy. Instead, it demands a collective effort to understand, a willingness to engage with the complexity of the human condition, and a commitment to finding pathways forward that honor the depth and richness of our shared existence.


As we navigate this terrain, let us do so with humility, recognizing that the task before us is not to assign blame but to seek understanding. By embracing the complexity of the problem and engaging in open, thoughtful dialogue, we can begin to unravel the threads of the Nihilistic Crisis and move towards a future that is both intellectually vibrant and emotionally fulfilling.


## Cyberpunk Neoliberalism


The synchronicity between the rise of neoliberalism and the codification of the cyberpunk genre is a fascinating intersection of economic theory and cultural expression. Neoliberalism, with its emphasis on corporatism, globalism, free market theory, and deregulation, has reshaped the global landscape since the late 20th century. Cyberpunk, emerging as a distinct genre in the same era, offered a narrative framework that eerily anticipated the societal and cultural implications of neoliberal policies. The genre's central theme of "high tech, low life" encapsulates the dichotomy of technological advancement and social decay that has come to characterize what many now refer to as "Late Stage Capitalism."


Cyberpunk's dystopian visions of the future, where corporate power is unchecked and individual lives are commodified, reflect a world in which nothing is sacred and everything is for sale. This ethos aligns closely with the neoliberal doctrine that seeks to extend market logic into every corner of human existence. In such a world, personal data, attention, and even dignity become commodities to be traded in the pursuit of profit. The recession of moral authority and the embrace of moral relativism have created a vacuum that corporate and private interests are all too eager to fill, exploiting the absence of shared values for monetary gain.


The exploitation of the human psyche, or the Id, is another trend that cyberpunk and neoliberalism share. In a world where nothing is sacred, corporations are free to employ attention engineering, propaganda, advertising, and misdirection to manipulate the public. By tapping into primal emotions—rage, disgust, lust, fear, pain—marketers and content creators can ensure that their messages not only capture attention but also drive engagement and, ultimately, profit. This manipulation of human psychology is vividly depicted in cyberpunk narratives, where gratuitous sex, violence, and sensationalism are common. Today, we see these same tactics employed in the real world, as media and advertising increasingly rely on shock value and emotional manipulation to cut through the noise of an oversaturated information landscape.


The parallels between cyberpunk's dystopian worlds and the realities of Late Stage Capitalism are striking. Both envision a future (or present) where technological advancement and corporate power have outstripped the capacity of traditional social and moral frameworks to provide meaning and guidance. In such a world, individuals are left to navigate a landscape defined by commodification, exploitation, and alienation.


However, while cyberpunk offers a critical lens through which to view the impact of neoliberalism, it also embodies a spirit of resistance and resilience. Cyberpunk protagonists, often marginalized and disenfranchised, find ways to subvert the system, leveraging technology and ingenuity to carve out spaces of autonomy and freedom. This aspect of the genre serves as a reminder that, even in the face of overwhelming corporate power and societal decay, there remains the potential for agency, creativity, and rebellion.


As we grapple with the realities of a world increasingly shaped by neoliberal policies and cyberpunk-esque dystopias, it is essential to remember that the future is not predetermined. By recognizing the challenges and contradictions of our present moment, we can begin to imagine and work towards alternative futures that prioritize human dignity, community, and the sanctity of the individual over the imperatives of the market. In doing so, we can reclaim the narrative from the dystopian visions that currently dominate our cultural and economic landscape, forging a path towards a more equitable and humane world.


## Double-Edged Sword


The intricate dance between nihilism, neoliberalism, and postmodernism forms a complex web that underpins much of contemporary society's structure and ethos. At the heart of this interplay is a profound reevaluation of values, freedom, and the role of the individual in the market-driven world. Neoliberalism, with its emphasis on free markets, privatization, and deregulation, posits a vision of society where individual freedom is paramount—but this freedom is inextricably linked to one's economic power. In essence, you are only as free as your dollar will take you. This principle, while ostensibly promoting equality by treating everyone's money and labor as equally valid, regardless of personal identity, also introduces a stark commodification of existence where the value of human life is measured in economic terms.


This commodification aligns with the nihilistic notion that nothing is sacred, a perspective that has gained traction in a world increasingly disillusioned with traditional moral and societal structures. In the vacuum left by the erosion of these structures, neoliberalism thrives, championing money as the ultimate arbiter of value and freedom. The message is clear: if you desire safety, experiences, or the "good life," the solution is to make more money. This ethos reflects a broader cultural shift towards viewing life through the lens of market transactions, where every aspect of existence, from personal identity to social relationships, is subject to the logic of the market.


The appeal of neoliberalism, particularly in its early stages, was its promise of moral freedom—the freedom to pursue individual meaning and set personal values in a world free from the constraints of traditional authority. This promise resonated with the postmodern critique of grand narratives and the quest for individual authenticity in a pluralistic world. However, the reality of neoliberalism has revealed a double-edged sword. The freedom it offers is contingent upon one's ability to participate in the market, creating a society where economic inequality translates directly into inequality of freedom and opportunity.


Neoliberalism, then, can be seen as an economic manifestation of nihilism and postmodernism, predicated on a worldview that eschews absolute values in favor of individual autonomy and market dynamics. Yet, this manifestation has led to unintended consequences, including the exacerbation of social and economic disparities, the erosion of communal bonds, and a pervasive sense of alienation and disconnection. The "nothing is sacred" attitude, while liberating in some respects, has also contributed to a societal landscape where the relentless pursuit of profit and efficiency undermines the human need for meaning, connection, and a sense of belonging.


As we grapple with the challenges posed by neoliberalism, it is crucial to recognize the underlying philosophical currents that have shaped its development. By understanding the connections between nihilism, postmodernism, and neoliberalism, we can begin to envision alternative models of society that balance individual freedom with communal responsibility, economic efficiency with social equity, and personal autonomy with a renewed sense of the sacred. This endeavor requires a critical reevaluation of our values and priorities, a willingness to engage with the complexities of the modern world, and a commitment to forging a path that transcends the limitations of the current paradigm. In doing so, we can move towards a future that embraces the richness and diversity of human experience while fostering a more just, compassionate, and meaningful world.


## Altar of Productivity


The altar of productivity, upon which modern society seems to have sacrificed so much, stands as a testament to a deep-seated obsession that permeates every aspect of our lives. This fixation on productivity, deeply ingrained in the national psyche, has profound implications for our emotional well-being, our relationships, and the very fabric of society. The liberation of women, while an undeniable ethical victory, serves as a poignant example of the complex interplay between societal progress and the relentless pursuit of productivity.


The report on the economic status of women by JFK marked a significant milestone in the financial liberation of women, setting the stage for a societal shift that would see women achieving unprecedented levels of educational and economic success. However, this shift also brought to light latent tensions, leading to an increase in divorces as women gained the financial independence necessary to leave unsatisfying or abusive relationships. Today, women are graduating from college at higher rates than men and purchasing more homes as young adults, achievements that reflect both the progress made and the challenges that remain.


At the heart of these challenges is the issue of childhood emotional abandonment, particularly of boys, who have been the unwitting casualties of societal fixations on patriarchy and stoicism. The emotional neglect of boys, under the guise of creating "tough men," has instead resulted in a generation of men who are fragile, disengaged, and struggling to find their place in a world that no longer values the stoic, patriarchal ideals of the past. While many young parents today are more emotionally literate than their predecessors, the legacy of emotional abandonment persists, exacerbated by a culture that remains obsessively focused on work and productivity.


The productivity obsession has transformed work from a means to an end into the central axis around which life revolves. Status games are played around side hustles, and there is a pervasive culture of shaming those who do not subscribe to the ethos of working harder and longer. Bragging about exhaustion and burnout has become a badge of honor, a perverse indicator of one's dedication to the religion of productivity. This culture can be traced back to the Protestant work ethic, a narrative that has been co-opted by corporations and politicians to justify and glorify the relentless pursuit of economic growth at the expense of human well-being.


The religion of productivity, much like the Roman Catholic Church of old, wields guilt as a powerful tool to enforce conformity and dedication to the cause. However, unlike the pursuit of spiritual salvation, the pursuit of productivity often leads to a hollowing out of the self, a loss of connection to what truly matters in life. The irony of this situation is that, in our quest to be more productive, we have become less effective at being human—less capable of forming deep connections, less able to find joy in the simple pleasures of life, and less attuned to the emotional needs of ourselves and others.


As we confront the consequences of our productivity obsession, it is crucial to reevaluate our priorities and consider what we have sacrificed in the name of efficiency and economic growth. By recognizing the value of emotional literacy, the importance of work-life balance, and the need for a more compassionate and humane approach to productivity, we can begin to heal the wounds inflicted by decades of emotional abandonment and societal neglect. It is only by challenging the prevailing narrative and forging a new path that prioritizes human well-being over economic output that we can hope to reclaim our souls from the altar of productivity and rediscover the true meaning of success and fulfillment.


# Towards Postnihilism


## Life is Good


Postnihilism emerges as a beacon of hope in a landscape marred by the desolation of nihilism, offering a path forward that affirms the inherent value and beauty of life. At its core, Postnihilism is built upon the axiomatic assertion that life is meaningful, valuable, interesting, and fundamentally good. This perspective stands in stark contrast to the nihilistic view that life is inherently devoid of meaning, challenging us to embrace the richness and complexity of our existence with open arms.


The rise of Postnihilism is a testament to the human capacity for resilience and renewal. It acknowledges the freedom that postmodernism highlighted—the freedom to construct our own narratives—and takes it a step further by asserting our right to reject narratives that do not serve our well-being. Nihilism may have proclaimed the liberty to create our own meaning, but it failed to recognize the profound human need for connection, purpose, and joy. Postnihilism seizes this oversight as an opportunity to redefine the narrative, choosing to live in a way that celebrates life rather than denigrating it.


This redefinition is evident in the growing popularity of movements such as slow living, anti-consumerism, anti-work, laying flat, and cottage core. These movements, each in their own way, represent a rejection of the relentless pursuit of productivity, consumption, and material success that has defined much of modern life. They embody a yearning for simplicity, authenticity, and a deeper connection to the natural world and to each other.


Gen Z's declaration "I do not dream of labor" encapsulates the Postnihilist ethos. Witnessing the burnout, stress, and existential despair that have plagued previous generations, many young people are choosing to opt out of the rat race altogether. They question the value of aspiring to a life defined by work, debt, and perpetual dissatisfaction, instead expressing a willingness to embrace a simpler existence, even if it means having less in material terms. This stance is not born of apathy but of a profound reevaluation of what it means to live a good life.


Postnihilism, therefore, is not a passive philosophy but an active and energetic rejection of nihilism and its destructive offspring, such as workaholism, neoliberalism, and emotional abandonment. It is a narrative of resistance and reconstruction, one that seeks to actively dismantle the harmful ideologies that have led us to the brink of despair. By affirming the value of life and rejecting the spiritually vacant beliefs that have dominated the cultural landscape, Postnihilism offers a way forward that is rooted in hope, connection, and a deep appreciation for the wonder of existence.


In embracing Postnihilism, we are called to actively engage in the creation of a world that reflects our highest values and aspirations. This involves not only rejecting the narratives that have harmed us but also working to build new structures and systems that support a more meaningful, equitable, and joyful way of life. It is a call to action, an invitation to participate in the collective project of healing our world and rediscovering the beauty and significance of life. In this way, Postnihilism transcends mere philosophy, becoming a movement that has the power to transform our individual lives and our society as a whole.


## Sources of Meaning


The quest for meaning in life has long been a central concern of philosophy, psychology, and, more recently, neuroscience. While the assertion of optimistic nihilism—that individuals are entirely free to construct their own meaning—offers a liberating perspective, it simplifies the complex processes through which humans actually find and create meaning. Scientific research and theoretical frameworks provide insights into the sources of meaning that are deeply embedded in our biology, psychology, and social structures.


Roger Walsh's concept of Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) highlights the importance of engaging in activities that are not only fulfilling but are also backed by scientific evidence as sources of meaning. These activities, including spending time in nature, nurturing relationships with loved ones, participating in community service, and engaging in spiritual practices, are shown to have profound effects on our well-being and sense of purpose. Each of these pillars addresses a fundamental aspect of the human experience, from our connection to the natural world to our need for social bonds and a sense of something greater than ourselves.


Similarly, Lawrence Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development provides a framework for understanding how our capacity for finding meaning evolves over time. According to Kohlberg, our moral reasoning develops through a series of stages, leading us to increasingly sophisticated understandings of ethics and values. This developmental perspective suggests that meaning is not merely a matter of individual choice but is also shaped by our growth and learning as moral beings. As we navigate life's challenges and dilemmas, we construct a sense of meaning that is informed by our evolving principles and values.


The role of relationships in the creation of meaning cannot be overstated. As social animals, humans derive a significant portion of their sense of purpose and fulfillment from their connections with others—friends, family, and romantic partners. These relationships provide a context in which we experience love, belonging, and support, all of which are essential components of a meaningful life. Nihilism, with its emphasis on the absence of inherent meaning, often overlooks the intrinsic value of these social bonds and the profound sense of purpose they can provide.


Will Storr's exploration of social status in "The Status Game" further underscores the social dimensions of meaning. Storr argues that our sense of self, esteem, and purpose is deeply intertwined with our perceived status within social hierarchies. While the pursuit of status can lead to competition and conflict, it also reflects a fundamental aspect of human nature—the desire for recognition and respect from our peers. In the context of the Nihilistic Crisis, the resentment towards social status and the rejection of its importance represent a denial of a key source of meaning and identity.


The rejection of social status and the broader rejection of traditional sources of meaning characteristic of nihilism represent a cutting off of one's nose to spite their face. By denying the value of relationships, moral development, and social engagement, nihilism overlooks the rich tapestry of experiences and connections that give life depth and significance.


In contrast, postnihilism, with its affirmation of life's inherent value and the potential for creating meaning, invites us to embrace these sources of meaning fully. By acknowledging the importance of relationships, community, nature, and spiritual engagement, we can begin to construct a sense of purpose that is both deeply personal and rooted in our shared human experience. This approach not only offers a way out of the Nihilistic Crisis but also provides a foundation for a life filled with meaning, connection, and fulfillment.


## Relationships, Experiences, Mission


In the quest for a life imbued with meaning and purpose, the Postnihilist framework of REM—Relationships, Experiences, and Mission—offers a simple yet profound model for navigating the complexities of existence. This framework encapsulates the essential elements that contribute to a fulfilling life, grounded in the understanding that meaning is not an abstract concept to be discovered but a lived reality to be cultivated through our actions and connections.


Relationships form the bedrock of the REM model. As social creatures, our lives are deeply intertwined with those of others, and it is through these connections that we find joy, support, and a sense of belonging. The importance of relationships in our lives cannot be overstated; they are the source of our greatest joys and our deepest comforts. From the bonds we share with friends and family to the love we give and receive from partners and children, relationships are where we find validation, understanding, and the strength to face life's challenges. To deny the value of social connections is to reject a fundamental aspect of what it means to be human. Embracing our social nature and nurturing our relationships is not only wise but essential for our well-being.


Experiences represent the second pillar of the REM model. Life is a tapestry woven from the moments we live, and it is the richness of our experiences that gives color and texture to our existence. Novelty, challenge, and impactful experiences shape who we are, forging our character and leaving indelible marks on our memory. Whether it's the struggles we've overcome, the adventures we've embarked on, or the boundaries we've pushed, these experiences form the stories we tell and the memories we cherish. They are what we reflect on at the end of our lives, the milestones that define our journey. By seeking out new experiences and embracing the challenges that come our way, we enrich our lives and expand our horizons, finding meaning in the journey itself.


Mission, the final pillar of the REM model, speaks to the need for purpose in our lives. Everyone needs a mission, a guiding principle or calling that provides direction and motivation. For some, this mission is chosen; for others, it emerges from the circumstances of their lives or the passions that have been instilled in them. Whether it's advocating for a cause, pursuing artistic excellence, or dedicating oneself to being a good parent, our mission imbues our actions with significance and drives us forward. It is the thread that connects our past, present, and future, giving coherence to our life story and fueling our sense of purpose.


The REM model—Relationships, Experiences, and Mission—offers a holistic approach to finding meaning in life. By focusing on these three pillars, we can build a life that is not only meaningful but also deeply satisfying. This framework challenges the nihilistic notion that life is devoid of inherent value, asserting instead that meaning is something we actively create through our connections, our experiences, and our pursuit of purpose. In embracing the REM model, we affirm the richness of life and our capacity to shape our own destiny, forging a path through the existential challenges of the modern world with resilience, joy, and a deep sense of fulfillment.


## Generating Relationships


In the intricate web of human existence, relationships stand as the most vibrant threads, connecting us in a complex pattern of emotional bonds and social interactions. The significance of these connections cannot be overstated; they are the foundation upon which we build our sense of self, our understanding of the world, and our place within it. However, the cultivation of meaningful relationships in today's fast-paced, productivity-obsessed society presents a formidable challenge. The investment of time—dozens of hours for casual friendships and up to 300 hours for deep, lasting bonds—is a testament to the effort required to forge these connections. Yet, the modern world, with its relentless emphasis on efficiency and social mobility, often leaves little room for such investments.


Compounding this challenge is a widespread aversion to conflict, coupled with a general deficit in emotional intelligence and conflict navigation skills. These deficiencies hinder our ability to form and maintain relationships, as they prevent us from engaging in the kind of open, honest communication that deep connections require. Moreover, an entire generation, marked by experiences of emotional abandonment and disillusionment, approaches the prospect of connection with apprehension and skepticism. The scars of past rejections and disappointments loom large, casting a shadow over the possibility of new relationships.


Despite these obstacles, the path to repairing the fabric of our social connections is not beyond reach. By committing to relearn the lost skills of emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and empathetic communication, we can begin to mend the tears in our social tapestry. This endeavor requires a deliberate effort to create more opportunities for friendship, to prioritize quality time with others, and to embrace the vulnerability that comes with genuine connection. It is through this process of deliberate engagement and mutual understanding that we can rediscover the joy and meaning that relationships bring to our lives.


Our social operating system, the framework through which we interpret our interactions and define our place in the social world, is fundamentally shaped by our relationships. It is within the context of these connections that we find our worth, value, and meaning—not in the superficial perceptions of others, but in the genuine bonds we share. Our relationships provide a mirror in which we see reflected not only our own selves but also the interconnectedness of all human experience. They remind us that we are not isolated entities navigating the world alone but part of a larger community, bound together by shared experiences, emotions, and aspirations.


In recognizing the central role of relationships in our lives, we acknowledge the profound impact they have on our sense of meaning and purpose. By investing in our connections with others, we invest in our own well-being and in the collective well-being of our communities. This investment, though it may require time and effort, yields dividends in the form of deeper understanding, greater empathy, and a richer, more fulfilling life. As we navigate the complexities of the modern world, let us remember that it is through our relationships that we find the most profound sources of meaning, and it is in each other that we discover our true worth and value.


## Meaningful Experiences


Experiences, the vibrant threads woven into the fabric of our lives, stand as powerful sources of meaning and fulfillment. Unlike material possessions, which often offer only fleeting satisfaction, experiences enrich our existence, providing memories and lessons that endure. They shape our identity, influence our perspectives, and connect us more deeply to the world around us. In the pursuit of a meaningful life, prioritizing experiences over artifacts is a principle that can guide us toward greater happiness and a more profound sense of purpose.


Traveling alone, for instance, offers an unparalleled opportunity for self-discovery and growth. It pushes us out of our comfort zones, challenging us to navigate unfamiliar environments, engage with new cultures, and rely on our own resourcefulness. These adventures, whether they lead us to bustling cities or remote landscapes, leave indelible marks on our psyche, fostering independence, resilience, and a deeper appreciation for the diversity of human experience.


Adventurous endeavors, whether they involve scaling mountains, learning a new skill, or simply trying something we've never done before, also play a crucial role in our quest for meaning. These experiences test our limits, confront us with our fears, and ultimately reveal our capacity for courage and perseverance. The sense of accomplishment that comes from facing and overcoming challenges is a source of lasting satisfaction and pride.


Sacrifice and charity represent another dimension of meaningful experiences. By dedicating our time and resources to causes greater than ourselves, we step beyond the boundaries of our individual lives and contribute to the well-being of others. Planting trees, volunteering at a local shelter, or participating in community projects are acts of generosity that not only benefit the recipients but also enrich our own lives. These experiences cultivate empathy, foster a sense of connection, and remind us of the impact we can have on the world.


Novelty, too, plays a vital role in the creation of meaningful experiences. Seeking out new experiences, whether they're as simple as trying a new cuisine or as complex as learning a new language, stimulates our curiosity and invigorates our spirit. Novel experiences break the monotony of routine, opening our eyes to the endless possibilities that life offers and encouraging us to embrace the unknown with enthusiasm and openness.


In essence, meaningful experiences—characterized by novelty, sacrifice, charity, and challenge—offer a pathway to a richer, more fulfilling life. They provide us with stories to tell, wisdom to share, and memories to cherish. By prioritizing these experiences over the accumulation of material possessions, we invest in our growth, happiness, and well-being. As we navigate the journey of life, let us seek out and embrace the experiences that challenge, inspire, and transform us, for it is through these adventures that we discover the true essence of meaning.


## Glorious Purpose


The concept of mission or purpose serves as the keystone in the architecture of a meaningful life. It is the animating force that propels us forward, imbuing our actions with significance and direction. This sense of purpose, often perceived as something larger than oneself, is a wellspring of motivation and fulfillment. It transforms the mundane into the extraordinary, lending a sense of coherence and continuity to our existence. Nietzsche's notion of the "will to power" can be interpreted as a manifestation of this drive for purpose, a fundamental impulse to assert one's will and achieve one's goals, which may indeed intersect with the pursuit of social status as a form of validation and recognition.


Mark Twain's assertion that "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why" encapsulates the profound impact of discovering one's purpose. This discovery is akin to uncovering a compass that guides us through life's complexities, providing clarity amidst confusion and hope in times of despair. Everyone, according to Twain, is born for a reason—a unique problem to solve, a contribution to make, a lesson to learn, or a summit to reach. This purpose is not merely a source of personal fulfillment but also a beacon that draws others to us, enhancing our social connections and enriching our relationships.


The pursuit of one's mission engenders a sense of focus and determination that is both compelling and attractive. It renders an individual interesting and engaging, qualities that naturally enhance one's social status and appeal. People are drawn to those who possess a clear sense of direction and passion, as these qualities resonate with our own desire for meaning and purpose. In this way, the pursuit of a mission not only enriches our own lives but also contributes to the lives of those around us, creating a virtuous cycle of inspiration and mutual growth.


Finding one's purpose, however, is not always a straightforward journey. It often requires introspection, experimentation, and a willingness to embrace both success and failure as integral parts of the learning process. For some, purpose is discovered through a calling that emerges early in life; for others, it is the culmination of diverse experiences and the gradual refinement of interests and passions. Regardless of the path, the pursuit of a mission imbues life with a sense of urgency and significance, transforming existence from a series of disconnected events into a coherent narrative driven by intention and aspiration.


In a world that can often seem chaotic and devoid of meaning, the quest for purpose stands as a beacon of hope and a source of strength. It is a reminder that, despite the challenges and uncertainties we face, each of us has the potential to make a unique contribution to the tapestry of human experience. By embracing our mission, we not only find direction and fulfillment in our own lives but also inspire others to embark on their own journeys of discovery. In this way, the pursuit of purpose becomes not just a personal endeavor but a collective one, enriching the lives of individuals and communities alike and weaving a richer, more meaningful narrative for us all.


## Good Enough Parents


Addressing the root of abandonment and nihilism necessitates a profound shift in how we approach parenting and early childhood development. At the heart of this shift is the concept of warm positive regard—a compassionate, affirming approach to child-rearing that fosters emotional security and resilience. This approach, distinct from overprotective or overly indulgent parenting styles, emphasizes the importance of validating children's feelings, encouraging their independence, and providing a stable foundation of love and support.


The antidote to childhood emotional neglect and the subsequent cascade of issues it precipitates, including the Nihilistic Crisis, lies in cultivating emotional literacy and competent parenting. Emotional literacy, the ability to understand and express emotions in a healthy way, is crucial for both parents and children. It enables parents to model effective emotional regulation and communication, thereby teaching their children how to navigate their own emotions and relationships.


Dr. Sue Johnson's ARE model—being Available, Responsive, and Engaged—offers a practical framework for building secure attachments between parents and children. By ensuring that parents are emotionally available to their children, responsive to their needs, and engaged in their lives, we can lay the groundwork for the development of securely attached adults. Considering that only 50% to 60% of the population is securely attached, the importance of widespread adoption of the ARE model cannot be overstated.


Furthermore, the concept of "good enough" parenting, introduced by British pediatrician and psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott, challenges the notion that parents must be perfect. Instead, it suggests that meeting a child's basic needs for love, security, and validation is sufficient for healthy emotional development. Unfortunately, just under 50% of parents meet this threshold of "good enough" parenting, highlighting a significant area for improvement in our collective approach to child-rearing.


To address these challenges, society must prioritize the promotion of good enough parenting, secure attachment, warm positive regard, and the principles of being available, responsive, and engaged. This requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses public health initiatives, educational programs, and community support systems designed to empower parents with the knowledge and resources they need to raise emotionally healthy children.


Moreover, this issue transcends the realm of public health and touches on deeper social and spiritual dimensions. By fostering environments where children feel valued, understood, and supported, we not only mitigate the effects of emotional neglect but also cultivate a generation of individuals who are better equipped to find meaning, build fulfilling relationships, and contribute positively to society.


In essence, addressing childhood emotional neglect and its far-reaching consequences is a task that demands collective action and a reevaluation of our societal values. By prioritizing the emotional well-being of children and supporting parents in their crucial role, we can begin to heal the wounds of abandonment and nihilism, paving the way for a future characterized by greater emotional resilience, deeper connections, and a renewed sense of purpose.


## Defending Postnihilism


Defending the core assertions that life is good, valuable, and meaningful is not merely an exercise in optimism but a stance grounded in both scientific inquiry and philosophical reasoning. From a scientific perspective, life is indeed one of the universe's most fascinating and rare phenomena. The intricate complexity of biological systems, the diversity of life forms, and the sheer improbability of life's emergence in the vast expanse of space and time underscore its uniqueness and value. This rarity and complexity make life inherently interesting, a subject of endless study, wonder, and exploration.


Philosophically, the process of "making meaning" is intrinsically tied to the existence of life. Life provides the canvas upon which meaning is painted; it is the substrate from which all meaning emerges. Without life, there would be no agents to conceive of or seek meaning, no experiences to interpret, and no relationships to give context to our existence. In this view, life is not just a prerequisite for meaning but is itself a source of meaning. The very act of living—of experiencing, learning, connecting, and striving—generates meaning, both individually and collectively.


The nihilistic assertion that "life is meaningless" and the postnihilistic counterclaim that "life is good" can indeed be seen as arbitrary narratives within the postmodern framework, which acknowledges the fluidity and subjectivity of meaning. This recognition of narrative fluidity empowers us to choose our stance towards life and meaning. We are free to reject the nihilistic perspective and embrace a view of life as inherently meaningful and valuable. This choice is not dictated by external authorities, be they nihilists, politicians, or societal norms, but is a declaration of personal autonomy and agency.


By affirming that "my life is meaningful to me, dammit!" we assert our right to define our own existence and to find joy, purpose, and value in our experiences and relationships. This assertion is not just a personal declaration but an invitation to others to recognize and affirm the value of their own lives. By extending this courtesy to everyone, we foster a culture that celebrates life's inherent worth and encourages the pursuit of meaning in all its forms.


In adopting this postnihilistic stance, we not only challenge the narrative of meaninglessness but also contribute to a collective reimagining of what it means to live a meaningful life. We open the door to a world where life's value is acknowledged, where the quest for meaning is embraced as a fundamental aspect of the human experience, and where each individual's pursuit of purpose is supported and celebrated.


Ultimately, the defense of life's goodness, value, and meaningfulness is both a personal journey and a communal endeavor. It requires us to actively engage with the world, to cultivate relationships and experiences that enrich our lives, and to pursue missions that give depth and direction to our existence. By choosing to view life through the lens of meaning and value, we not only enrich our own lives but also contribute to the creation of a more compassionate, understanding, and meaningful world.


# Conclusion


As we draw the curtains on this exploration of Postnihilism, it's important to acknowledge that the journey towards a more meaningful and connected world is unlikely to be swift or straightforward. Postnihilism, as a named movement, now possesses the power that comes with identification—a power that can galvanize, inspire, and unify. Yet, the reality remains that such a philosophical shift might not immediately resonate on a global scale or may never achieve widespread adoption. However, the very act of naming it, of defining the REM model—Relationships, Experiences, Mission—and addressing the roots of nihilism and emotional neglect from birth, imbues this movement with a tangible form and a clear direction.


The path to overcoming the pervasive sense of nihilism that has infiltrated our society and addressing the epidemic of loneliness and emotional abandonment is a long one, potentially spanning generations. The scars inflicted by nihilism are deep, manifesting in widespread disconnection, despair, and a sense of meaninglessness. Yet, it is precisely because we have, as a society, reached what feels like rock bottom that the imperative to move beyond nihilism becomes all the more urgent. The increasing rates of loneliness and the palpable sense of isolation that many feel today serve as stark evidence that the nihilistic narrative offers no solace, no solution to our collective malaise.


The hope for Postnihilism lies in its simplicity and accessibility. By framing the movement around the REM model and emphasizing the importance of addressing childhood emotional neglect, we offer a blueprint for building a life of meaning and connection. This framework, while straightforward in concept, acknowledges the complexity of human experience and the challenges inherent in changing deeply ingrained patterns of thought and behavior. Implementing these principles in our lives and communities will undoubtedly be challenging, but the recognition of this challenge is the first step towards meaningful change.


As we move forward, it's crucial to remember that the journey towards Postnihilism is not a solitary endeavor but a collective one. It requires the participation of individuals, families, communities, and institutions, all working together to foster environments where relationships are nurtured, experiences are valued, and missions are pursued with passion and purpose. It is in the shared commitment to this vision that we find hope and the potential for transformation.


In giving Postnihilism a name and a framework, we have laid the groundwork for a movement that seeks to reclaim the narrative of our lives from the clutches of nihilism. This book is but a starting point, an invitation to join in the collective effort to build a world where life is recognized as inherently meaningful, valuable, and good. The road ahead may be long and fraught with challenges, but the act of beginning, of taking that first step towards something new and hopeful, is in itself a victory. And for now, that's good enough.
